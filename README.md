App for keeping score during an intense game of darts Created with XCode using Swift Created in order to allow users to keep track of a darts game Motivation: My family has a darts board and can never keep track of the score in our heads :) The current application is still under development, and the current stage is mainly to test the continuity of the main interface UI and the integrity of the logical operation. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me
